# This is a factor analysis conducted using World Values Survey data to ascertain the latent structure of the data set. 
# The analysis is conducted on scale and interval variables from the data set.
# Data were cleaned, determined to be adequately correlated using KMO adequacy measure and Bartlett's test for sphericity
# Used Eigenvectors and scree plot to determine number of factors to be extracted
# Examined factor loadings and assessed fit to determine best number of factors to be extracted
# Refined factor differentiation using rotation (orthagonal or oblique)
# Comparde relative factor loading and factor stability between different number of factors
